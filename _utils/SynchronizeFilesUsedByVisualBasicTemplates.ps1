# Overwrite all XAML files in VB directories with files from comparable C# folders. 
# XAML files should be the same for both C# & VB so this means changes can be made for C# and then easily copied for the VB templates.
# This is necessary because the way template folders are copied and filtered means that, for example, the VB templates can't point to files in the C# folders.
